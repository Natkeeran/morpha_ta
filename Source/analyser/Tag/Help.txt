Atcharam (Tamil Morphological Analyser) 1.0

ABOUT

	In Tamil, most of the morphemes coordinate with the root words in the form of suffixes. Morphological analyzer takes an inflected word as input and separates  its root word and associated morphemes. The function of each suffix is indicated . A rule based approach is used.

Eg:

ñôó¢è¬÷:
ñôó¢ < Noun > 
è÷¢ < Plural > 
ä < AccCase >
